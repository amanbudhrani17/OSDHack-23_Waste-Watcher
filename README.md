>"There is no such thing as "Away". When we throw anything away, it must go somewhere." <br />

## Problem Statement  ðŸ’»<br />

1)  Garbage is thrown over several streets and locations in India and is not cleared.
2)  Cleaning workers have no clue where the waste is, and municipal officials have no way of tracking their activity.
3)  Alack of communication between authorities and cleaners results in a significant loss of manpower.

**Project Name**:  Waste Watcher <br />
**Tag Line**:   A drone that hunts waste<br />

### Solution we implemented -
1) We implemented automted drones with predefined paths that look for waste across the path.
2) The detected garbage location will be sent directly to the Municipality and cleaning workers as a text message and will also be notified in the Webapp.
3) Once the cleaner has cleaned the area, he will mark it on the app and our Webapp will send the message to Municipal Corporation.
4) Our drone will again go to the location, inspect and ensure that the designated spots are cleaned.  
5) orkers can filter and choose the sites on our app nearest to them or the spots with the most waste within a 2KM radius.
